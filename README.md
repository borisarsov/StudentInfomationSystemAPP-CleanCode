# StudentInfomationSystemAPP-CleanCode
The idea of this system is to simulate "student information system".  Administrators have the opportunity to view and manage students data. Students have the right to see their grades( and additional info) and possibly evaluate the course. Instead of a database, a binary file is used to store the necessary information.
